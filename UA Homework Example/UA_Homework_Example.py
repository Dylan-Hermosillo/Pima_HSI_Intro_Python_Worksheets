Many of us start our programming career here at Pima and switch to a 4-year institution.
A lot of the intro programming courses are similar in scope to what we learn at Pima.

That being said, many students worry about the level of difficulty when transferring, 
so let's take a look at a UofA homework on functions for an intro programming course!

Many UA courses have hundreds of students and rely on Teacher Assistants (TA's) or Section Leader's (SL) to grade.
These are undergrad students like yourself. So they rely on scripts that tell you what your grade is when you run it.

Besides this script, there is another called 'UofA_Homework_Test.py', that when ran will tell you what grade you
would have got on this homework assignment. It's pretty specific in the function names and file names.

We've also included a PDF of the full instructions with some extra instructions on
running the test and understanding the output 

There's also a 'UA_Solutions.py' File that shows functions that return a 100% correct score.

'''
Problem 1
Write a function called chases that has two string parameters.
The first is a predator, the second a prey animal.
You will use these to print a line per the examples below.
You must match this output format (i.e. if you call your function with the
same arguments as in the examples your output should look like the output in
the examples):

chases('dragon', 'human') # Function Call
    The dragon chases the human # Output

Problem 2
Write a function called sum3 that takes three numerical arguments
and prints their sum in this format:

sum3(1, 2, 3) # Function Call
   The sum of the arguments is: 6 # Output
'''
# Start Here
def

Problem 3
Write a function called forecast that has no parameters.
Import the random module and use random.randrange(101)
to get an integer between 0 and 100. This is your forecasted chance of rain,
which will be different every time.
Print it in the following format:

forecast() # Function call
   Chance of rain today: 59 % # Output
'''
# Start Here
def

'''
Problem 4
Write a function called radians that takes an angle in degrees and prints it converted to radians.
The formula for turning an angle in degrees into radians is:

radians = degrees * π / 180.

Use math.pi for π (You'll need to import math). You should round the result to three decimal places using the built-in round function.
The documentation is here. 

radians(200) # Function Call
    The angle in radians is: 3.491 # Output

'''
Problem 5
Write a function called decimal that takes a number. Print the decimal part in the format below.
To get the decimal part, subtract the floor of the number from the number using math.floor.
Round the result to three decimal places.Here are some examples of calling the function with different arguments. (

decimal(5.983) # Function Call
    Decimal part: 0.983 # Output

'''
Problem 6
Write a function called erf_plus_gamma that takes a number and prints the error function of the number
plus the gamma function of the number in the format shown below. Use math.erf and math.gamma and round
the result to three decimal places. Here are some examples of calling the function 

erf_plus_gamma(0.6) # Function Call
    Result: 2.093 # Output
